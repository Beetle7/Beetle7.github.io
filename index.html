            <p>
                 I like to think of myself as someone creative and inventive. I've always had a passion for finding out new things, and that has led me to think in research lies my path in life. I'm interested in mostly theoretical maths, physics, genealogy, mycology, evolution, nuclear chemistry, and intricacies of english, such as word etymology, accents and slangs. In fact, I've written a few short stories as well! For fun, I play chess, read Sci-Fi and webnovels. I also enjoy debating about philosophy, religion and morality. As far as videogames go, I always love a good platformer style game. I also LOVE LEGOs!

            <p>
                 Despite spending most of life in Hyderabad, I was actually born in Cleveland, Ohio. This is why I'm very happy the Cavs are doing so well despite not watching the NBA. I left when I was 4 years old, which was 2010. Here are some photos I've dug up:-
